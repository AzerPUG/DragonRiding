# Description and Features
AzerPUG's DragonRider remakes the Vigor icons and Vigor regeneration bar and puts it on the screen, providing you with a way to get this information, even when not actively on a Dragon Riding mount. Sadly this is needed because the game native Vigor icons and Vigor regeneration bar are hidden by the game as soon as you are no longer mounted.
There is a lot more functionality and Quality of Life coming, check back on CurseForge regularly to see if an update is ready!
